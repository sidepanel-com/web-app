# Documentation Rules

Before creating or modifying files in `/docs`, read `docs/README.md` for the writing rules and file structure.

- Each file has one role. Do not mix architecture with term definitions or constraints with orientation.
- Do not duplicate content across docs files. Reference with relative markdown links instead.
- `/docs` covers system-level architecture. Code-local READMEs (`src/spaces/*/README.md`, `db/*/README.md`) cover implementation patterns. Do not duplicate code-level content in `/docs`.
- Glossary definitions must be neutral. No rules or constraints in glossary entries.
- Delete outdated content before adding new content.
