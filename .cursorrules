# Project Guidelines for Coding Agents

You are working on a multi-tenant platform built with Next.js, Drizzle ORM, and Supabase.

## Architecture: Spaces and Schemas

The project is strictly divided into **Platform** and **Product** spaces. See `docs/architecture.md` for the full layer model.

### 1. The Platform Space (`src/spaces/platform/`, `db/platform/`)

- Contains core infrastructure: Auth, Multi-tenancy, User management, Billing.
- **DO NOT MODIFY** files in these directories unless explicitly instructed.
- If you need a platform-level change, suggest it rather than implementing it.

### 2. The Product Space (`src/spaces/product/`)

- This is your primary area of contribution for UI, hooks, and services.
- Follow the patterns established in `src/spaces/product/README.md`.

### 3. Database Schemas (Drizzle + Supabase)

The product database is split into two schemas:

- **Ledger** (`db/ledger/`) — Canonical reality: people, companies, comms, activities. Immutable record of what happened.
- **Packages** (`db/packages/`) — Business interpretations: projections, workflow state, package-specific tables.

Rules:

- Every table in both schemas **MUST** have a `tenant_id` column and foreign key to `platform.tenants`.
- Ledger tables must not contain business workflow state, CRM concepts, or package logic.
- Package tables must not duplicate or redefine canonical ledger data.
- Use `npm run db:generate` to create migrations.

## UI Guidelines

- Use `@/ui-primitives/ui/*` for base components (Shadcn UI).
- Wrap all tenant-specific pages in `src/pages/[tenantSlug]/` with the `<AppPage>` component.
- Add new navigation items to `src/spaces/product/navigation.tsx`.

## Coding Standards

- Follow Biome linting/formatting rules (`npm run lint`, `npm run format`).
- Use TypeScript strictly.
- Prefer functional components and React hooks.
